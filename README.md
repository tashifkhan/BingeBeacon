## Backend (Go) Implementation

A Go backend is being implemented to support the TV/Movie alert system. It will provide API endpoints for:

- Show/movie alerts (tracking, notifications)
- Timeline management (new episodes, seasons, etc.)
- Integration with OMDB, TMDB, and TheTVDB for metadata and episode tracking
- Push notifications (for tracked shows, new seasons, new episodes, favorites)

**Note:** Database integration is marked as TODO and will be implemented later.
